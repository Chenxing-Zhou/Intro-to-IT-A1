    <p>The results of these tests gave me a better understanding of who I am and my role in teamwork. 
      Based on the analysis and suggestions of the results, I know that I may make decisions easily because of my own feelings, 
      so I will listen to other people's suggestions when making decisions and innovations.
      And form a team with rational people, which can reduce the error rate of my judgment. In addition, 
      I will also use my outgoing and confident characteristics to help the team cooperate and communicate better.</p>
