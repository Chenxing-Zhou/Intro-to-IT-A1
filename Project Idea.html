    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    
    <p>I hope to bring innovation in the field of speech recognition, such as Google real-time translation, but I hope to improve its transcription speed and accuracy on this basis, 
      and at the same time create a huge database and give the software a certain learning ability. At the same time, the chat bot can answer some consulting questions by extracting keywords.</p>
    
    <p>And this project will be able to break people's different language barriers, and also help people to better understand and record in conferences and academic speeches, 
      which is very useful. Personally, because English is not my mother tongue, and when I work in a group, I cannot accurately express my opinions in English, 
      which will slow down the work progress and cause misunderstandings. Therefore, I believe that simultaneous interpretation software based on the implementation of transcription is urgently needed in today's economic globalization. From 1999 to 2005, 
      the speech recognition technology market is growing at a rate of 31% per year. Nowadays, in smartphones such as iPhones, 
      voice assistants have become a standard feature, bringing a lot of convenience to users, which can be seen The speech recognition field has a very broad market.</p>
