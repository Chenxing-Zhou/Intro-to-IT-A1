    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    
    <p>I hope to bring innovation in the field of speech recognition, such as Google real-time translation, but I hope to improve its transcription speed and accuracy on this basis, 
      and at the same time create a huge database and give the software a certain learning ability. At the same time, the chat bot can answer some consulting questions by extracting keywords.</p>
    
    <p>And this project will be able to break people's different language barriers, and also help people to better understand and record in conferences and academic speeches, 
      which is very useful. Personally, because English is not my mother tongue, and when I work in a group, I cannot accurately express my opinions in English, 
      which will slow down the work progress and cause misunderstandings. Therefore, I believe that simultaneous interpretation software based on the implementation of transcription is urgently needed in today's economic globalization. From 1999 to 2005, 
      the speech recognition technology market is growing at a rate of 31% per year. Nowadays, in smartphones such as iPhones, 
      voice assistants have become a standard feature, bringing a lot of convenience to users, which can be seen The speech recognition field has a very broad market.</p>
    
    <p>Bill Gates once said: "Voice technology will make the computer lose the mouse and keyboard." With the miniaturization of computers, keyboards and mice have become a major obstacle to the development of computers. 
      This means that we need to quickly and accurately issue commands to the computer through voice recognition. The characteristics of this project are accuracy and timeliness. 
      The product needs to have the same language real-time recording and multi-language real-time translation function, 
      we need to collect more language information for this (such as text translation in different contexts, and automatic grammar correction, 
      this is because some languages Syntax is different), and enter it into the database in time. We also need to make improvements in the aspects of adaptation and algorithm models, 
      because the language input by the user may not be standardized enough because of the presence of accents, which will cause the output result to be far from the input. 
      Finally, the results of the analysis are displayed in the form of text. And the same product will also have the function of text-to-speech, 
      through the search for the pronunciation of different words in the database, and finally the text is converted into speech.</p>
    
    <p>In terms of robustness, speech recognition technology needs to be able to exclude the influence of various environmental factors. At present, the environmental noise or voice has the greatest impact on speech recognition. 
      In public, it is almost impossible to expect a computer to understand your words. Voices from all directions make it bewildered and at a loss. 
      Obviously, this greatly limits the application range of speech technology. We will conduct research on speech coding to deal with the special characteristics of sound signals. 
      And the technology of probabilistic grammar analysis that can identify large-length segments is mainly to complete the "differentiating language characteristics", 
      and use the corresponding level of knowledge to solve the different levels of knowledge. The biggest shortcoming of this method is that there are certain difficulties in establishing an effective and appropriate applicable knowledge system. Combining the above functions to improve the database, 
      the mutual conversion of speech and text can provide more reference for machine learning, so we can also make innovations in the field of computer automatic answering questions.</p>
    
    <p>When outputting text, we will also ensure the reasonableness of the text's grammar and context, so as to allow users to obtain the information they want to the greatest extent. We will also add a save service for this to prevent file loss due to incorrect operations.</p>
    
    <p>The environment setting steps of a general speech recognition program include the collection and setting of CTI server hardware default parameters, 
      the initialization of the recognition hardware acquisition card, and the engine port setting. The settings of the speech dictionary include grammar, 
      rules for speech recognition, and production of speech templates, etc., according to the rules of the speech platform. When setting the voice dictionary, 
      first set up the core package of voice recognition, and then complete all the settings of the dictionary according to the rules of the voice compiled by yourself. 
      At the same time, the speech recognition system can be classified according to the restrictions on the input speech (such as speaking style and vocabulary).</p>
    
    <p>This project requires workers to master the knowledge of the database, because this project usually uses a large number of different people's speech databases to learn the recognition system, and the workers need to have certain research on speech coding. 
      And in the final stage of compiling the speech recognition program, the programmer needs to write a GUI (Graphical User Interface) interface for the main program so that the user can interact with the computer. At the same time, 
      the specific effect of the project also depends on the equipment used and Use environment (such as a microphone with noise reduction effect will have a better experience).</p>
    
    <p>If this project is successful, it will more effectively promote the development of economic globalization. At the same time, because of the mutual conversion of text and voice files, this will help students and workers reduce stress and improve work efficiency. 
      Moreover, the success of this project can help deaf-mute people better integrate into their daily lives and provide them with new ways of communication. In the future life, voice recognition will also appear more in life. 
      People can give accurate instructions through voice to complete what they want to do, which will improve people's quality of life.</p>
