    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    
    <p>I hope to bring innovation in the field of speech recognition, such as Google real-time translation, but I hope to improve its transcription speed and accuracy on this basis, 
      and at the same time create a huge database and give the software a certain learning ability. At the same time, the chat bot can answer some consulting questions by extracting keywords.</p>
    
    <p>And this project will be able to break people's different language barriers, and also help people to better understand and record in conferences and academic speeches, 
      which is very useful. Personally, because English is not my mother tongue, and when I work in a group, I cannot accurately express my opinions in English, 
      which will slow down the work progress and cause misunderstandings. Therefore, I believe that simultaneous interpretation software based on the implementation of transcription is urgently needed in today's economic globalization. From 1999 to 2005, 
      the speech recognition technology market is growing at a rate of 31% per year. Nowadays, in smartphones such as iPhones, 
      voice assistants have become a standard feature, bringing a lot of convenience to users, which can be seen The speech recognition field has a very broad market.</p>
    
    <p>Bill Gates once said: "Voice technology will make the computer lose the mouse and keyboard." With the miniaturization of computers, keyboards and mice have become a major obstacle to the development of computers. 
      This means that we need to quickly and accurately issue commands to the computer through voice recognition. The characteristics of this project are accuracy and timeliness. 
      The product needs to have the same language real-time recording and multi-language real-time translation function, 
      we need to collect more language information for this (such as text translation in different contexts, and automatic grammar correction, 
      this is because some languages Syntax is different), and enter it into the database in time. We also need to make improvements in the aspects of adaptation and algorithm models, 
      because the language input by the user may not be standardized enough because of the presence of accents, which will cause the output result to be far from the input. 
      Finally, the results of the analysis are displayed in the form of text. And the same product will also have the function of text-to-speech, 
      through the search for the pronunciation of different words in the database, and finally the text is converted into speech.</p>
