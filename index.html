    <h2>Personal background</h2>
        <p>I was born in Zhejiang, China. My parents and an older brother who is seven years older than me are also from China,
          so Chinese is our mother tongue.</p>
        <p>I graduated from a high school in China in 2019 and studied at RMIT Foundation Studies in 2020, 
          and now it is my first year of studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I like traveling very much, but due to COVID-19, I can only stay at home. 
          Because of staying at home for a long time, I started to like games, (DOTA2, csgo and Genshin), 
          because the existence of games can greatly relieve my fatigue and loneliness. 
          Of course watching anime is also one of my hobbies (ONE PIECE, etc.), and I will not refuse the opportunity to take a short trip.</P>
    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <p>I am interested in cyber security and artificial intelligence in the IT field, 
          and these interests come from two movies I have watched (The Matrix, The Terminator). 
          My brother is a guide for me to study IT. He graduated from Monash University and successfully completed all the content of the Bachelor of IT. 
          At that time, it was a cool thing for me, who was in junior high school, to watch him write code that I couldnâ€™t understand, 
          and it was this reason that made me interested in learning about computers.</p>
        <p>IT has very good employment prospects in China, which means that after I graduate, 
          I don't need to worry about my employment. The scope of IT learning is very wide, 
          which means that I can choose my favorite course, which is much better than some compulsory courses that I am not interested in, 
          and has the support of my family, so I choose to study IT.</p>
