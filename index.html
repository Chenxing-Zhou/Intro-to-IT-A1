    <h2>Personal background</h2>
    <p>I was born in Zhejiang, China. My parents and an older brother who is seven years older than me are also from China,
    so Chinese is our mother tongue.</p>
    <p>I graduated from a high school in China in 2019 and studied at RMIT Foundation Studies in 2020, 
    and now it is my first year of studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology</p>
    <h2>Hobby</h2>
    <p>I like traveling very much, but due to COVID-19, I can only stay at home. 
    Because of staying at home for a long time, I started to like games, (DOTA2, csgo and Genshin), 
    because the existence of games can greatly relieve my fatigue and loneliness. 
    Of course watching anime is also one of my hobbies (ONE PIECE, etc.), and I will not refuse the opportunity to take a short trip.</P>
